Visualizing heightmaps in 3D viewer

### How to Run

This sample may currently be outdated and thus might not work properly with the newest version of SICK AppStudio.

Starting this sample is possible either by running the app (F5) or
debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event.
Results can be seen in the 3D viewer on the DevicePage.
Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show images after loading the webpage.
To run this Sample a device with SICK Algorithm API and AppEngine >= V2.5.0 is
required. For example SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the Emulator
on AppStudio 2.3 or higher can be used
